# ChatGPT API
This is a page that uses the ChatGPT API to make prompt requests from an interface almost identical to ChatGPT itself, mimicking the saving of conversations and creation of new chats;

IMPORTANT: For the API to work, add your ChatGPT API_Key in the .env file If you don’t know how to create your API_key:

1. Go to the official OpenAI page, go to the API/DOCS section.
2. Register with your account.
3. Go to the “API keys” section and create your secret key.
4. Copy the given text, place it in the .env file.

And that’s it, you can start using the ChatGPT API.
